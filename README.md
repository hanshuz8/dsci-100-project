# Title: Predicting Newsletter Subscriptions from Minecraft Player Data
# 1. Introduction
# In this project, we aim to predict whether a player of a Minecraft-based research server subscribes to a game-related newsletter, based on demographic and behavioral data. The project uses two datasets: one describing players, and another describing session activity.
